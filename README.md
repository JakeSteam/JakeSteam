# Hello, I'm Jake! 👋

I work as a Staff Android Engineer at 🐸[Seatfrog](https://seatfrog.com/)🐸, and do open source web-y / writing-y things in my spare time. 

My current big projects are:

* 🕴️ [BountyHour.com](https://bountyhour.com), a microcontracting marketplace.
* ⚛️ Learning [React](https://react.dev/) / [next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
