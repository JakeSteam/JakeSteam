### Hello!

I'm **Jake**, a Staff Android Engineer @ 🐸[Seatfrog](https://seatfrog.com/)🐸

I write a weeklyish newsletter called [Jake Week Lee](https://jakeweeklee.substack.com) (yes, a pun!), and in the past made Android games (e.g. 🔨[Pixel Blacksmith](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.jakelee.blacksmith&hl=en_GB&gl=US)🔨). I also [read a lot](https://www.goodreads.com/jakesteam
) and occasionally [take pictures](https://www.instagram.com/jakeleeuk/) (mostly of my cat 🐈Cassie🐈...).

I write regularly about [software development](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk), [internet history](https://history.jakelee.co.uk), and [everything else](https://jakelee.co.uk), here's the latest few articles:
