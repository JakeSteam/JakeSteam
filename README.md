### Hello!

- 👤 I'm an Android dev / Engineering manager in his 30s based near London.
- 📩 I write a weekly newsletter called [Jake Week Lee](https://jakeweeklee.substack.com) (yes, a pun!)
- ✍ I blog regularly about [technology](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk), [internet history](https://history.jakelee.co.uk), and [everything else](https://jakelee.co.uk).
- 🎮 In a past life I made indie games (e.g. Pixel Blacksmith), they're all open source.
