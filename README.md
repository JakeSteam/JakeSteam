### Hello!

- 👤 I'm a Staff Android Engineer in his 30s based near London.
- 📩 I write a weeklyish newsletter called [Jake Week Lee](https://jakeweeklee.substack.com) (yes, a pun!).
- 🎮 In the past I made Android games (e.g. [Pixel Blacksmith](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.jakelee.blacksmith&hl=en_GB&gl=US)), they're all open source now.
- ✍ I blog regularly about [software development](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk), [internet history](https://history.jakelee.co.uk), and [everything else](https://jakelee.co.uk).
