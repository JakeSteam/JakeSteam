  # Hello, I'm Jake! 👋

I work as a Staff Android Engineer at 🐸[Seatfrog](https://seatfrog.com/)🐸, and do open source web-y / writing-y things in my spare time. 

My current big projects are:
* ⚛️ Finally learning modern web dev ([React](https://react.dev/) / [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) / [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) / [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)).
* 🕴️ [BountyHour.com](https://bountyhour.com), a microcontracting marketplace.
